#
# === Parameters
#
# [*arch*]
#   The operating system architecture. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "os.arch", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*resource_name*]
#   The operating system name. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "os.name", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
#
# [*object_name*]
#   String representation the object name of this platform managed object.
#
# [*version*]
#   The operating system version. If a security manager is installed and it does not allow access to system property "os.version", then a "read-attribute" operation reading this attribute will fail, and the value for this attribute in the result for the "read-resource" operation will be "undefined".
