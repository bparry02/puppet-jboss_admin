# === Parameters
#
# [*access_mechanism*]
#   The mechanism used to submit a request to the server.

# [*caller_thread*]
#   The name of the thread that is executing the operation.
#
# [*cancelled*]
#   Whether the operation has been cancelled.
#
# [*exclusive_running_time*]
#   Amount of time the operation has been executing with the exclusive operation execution lock held, or -1 if the operation does not hold the exclusive execution lock.
#
# [*execution_status*]
#   The current activity of the operation.
#
# [*operation*]
#   The name of the operation, or '<hidden>' if the caller is not authorized to address the operation's target resource.
#
