#
# The root node of the server-level management model.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*launch_type*]
#   The manner in which the server process was launched. Either "DOMAIN" for a domain mode server launched by a Host Controller, "STANDALONE" for a standalone server launched from the command line, or "EMBEDDED" for a standalone server launched as an embedded part of an application running in the same virtual machine.
#
# [*management_major_version*]
#   The major version of the JBoss AS management interface that is provided by this server.
#
# [*management_micro_version*]
#   The micro version of the JBoss AS management interface that is provided by this server.
#
# [*management_minor_version*]
#   The minor version of the JBoss AS management interface that is provided by this server.
#
# [*resource_name*]
#   The name of this server. If not set, defaults to the runtime value of InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName().
#
# [*namespaces*]
#   Map of namespaces used in the configuration XML document, where keys are namespace prefixes and values are schema URIs.
#
# [*process_type*]
#   The type of process represented by this root resource. Always has a value of "Server" for a server resource.
#
# [*product_name*]
#   The name of the JBoss AS based product that is being run by this server.
#
# [*product_version*]
#   The version of the JBoss AS based product release that is being run by this server.
#
# [*profile_name*]
#   The name of the server's configuration profile.
#
# [*release_codename*]
#   The codename of the JBoss Application Server release this server is running.
#
# [*release_version*]
#   The version of the JBoss Application Server release this server is running.
#
# [*running_mode*]
#   The current running mode of the server. Either NORMAL (normal operations) or ADMIN_ONLY.  An ADMIN_ONLY server will start any configured management interfaces and accept management requests, but will not start services used for handling end user requests.
#
# [*schema_locations*]
#   Map of locations of XML schemas used in the configuration XML document, where keys are schema URIs and values are locations where the schema can be found.
#
# [*server_state*]
#   The current state of the server controller; either STARTING, RUNNING or RESTART_REQUIRED
